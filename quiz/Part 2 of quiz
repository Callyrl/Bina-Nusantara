C.	The getdecription() in the Confundo class is being excecuted.

    class Accio(Spell):
        def __init__(self):
            Spell.__init__(self, ’Accio’, ’Summoning Charm’) 
        def get_description(self):
            return 'This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance'
